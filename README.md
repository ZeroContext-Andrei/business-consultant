## 5. Available Scripts

| Command           | Description                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`     | Start a hot-reloading dev server          |

## 6. Building for Production

Running `npm run build` generates a fully static site in the **`dist/`** directory. The output is minified, tree-shaken and ready to be served from any static hosting provider.

## 7. Deployment

Because the site is completely static, you can deploy **`dist/`** using platforms such as:

â€¢ Vercel  
â€¢ Netlify  
â€¢ GitHub Pages  
â€¢ Cloudflare Pages  
â€¢ An S3 bucket behind a CDN or any traditional web server
